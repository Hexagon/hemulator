# agents.md

Purpose: guidance for automated agents and maintainers about CI, formatting, and safety.

- **Keep track of the work**: Keep a todo in TODO.md
- **Project structure**: workspace with `crates/core`, `crates/systems/*`, and `crates/frontend/*`.
- **Agent tasks**:
  - Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` on PRs.
  - Build the workspace (`cargo build --workspace`).
  - Run unit/integration tests (`cargo test`).
  - Optionally run benchmarks in a separate job.
- **Permissions & safety**:
  - Agents must not add or distribute ROMs or other copyrighted game data.
  - Agents may run tests that do not require ROMs; for ROM-based tests, maintainers must provide legal test ROMs off-repo.
- **Cross-platform notes**:
  - Frontends use `minifb` and `rodio` which are cross-platform; CI should include at least Linux and Windows runners.
  - For macOS specifics, `rodio` may require additional CI setup; document platform checks in CI config.
- **When to notify maintainers**:
  - Failing build or tests, or lint errors.
  - Long-running benchmark jobs exceeding expected time.

Local reproduction: run the same commands the agent runs (build, clippy, test) from the workspace root.
